## Error notifications for backend jobs

Objective
We need to be notified when backend jobs fail.  
Software Requirements
Ensure all jobs are fully wrapped in a try /Â catch block
This catch should email a new jobs@paykit.io email if it fails
Note that this should be configurable by environment, so we can specify which email address to send to
Dev can be dev.jobs@paykit.io
Local would be our own personal emails for testing
Supabase Optional Requirements
Supabase may have job monitoring and notifications built in.  If they do, we should leverage this as a secondary guard.  We don't want to get stuck with vendor lock-in, so we still want to send our own emails.

## Harden Payment Processing Job to Prevent Duplicate Charges

Description
The file supastripe/supabase/functions/process-due-payments/index.ts has a weakness in it where the job COULD create a PaymentIntent in Stripe but then fail to update the database.  This would result in a second attempt at the same transaction and a duplicate PaymentIntent to be created.
Requirements
On line 47 we see this:
  // Create a PaymentIntent
  const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: Math.round(transaction.amount * 100), // amount in cents
    currency: 'usd',
    customer: customer.stripe_customer_id,
    metadata: {
      transaction_id: transaction.id,
      payment_plan_id: transaction.payment_plan_id,
    },
  })

  // Update the transaction with the PaymentIntent ID
  await supabase
    .from('transactions')
    .update({ stripe_payment_intent_id: paymentIntent.id })
    .eq('id', transaction.id)
This needs to be hardened to prevent the PaymentIntent from being created more than once.  A suggestion would be:

Add a new DB field to the transaction table called "IS_PROCESSING"; it can be a BOOLEAN
For each transaction:
Check IS_PROCESSING
If TRUE
Check Stripe for a payment intent with this transaction ID
If one exists:
we've already charged, do nothing and proceed to the below logic
If one does NOT exist:
Create a PaymentIntent.  We attempted to create the PaymentIntent but something failed
If FALSE
Create a PaymentIntent
Update the transaction status to DONE an set IS_PROCESSING to FALSE

## Harden Payment Processing Job for performance purposes

We're currently selecting ALL payment plans that are due.  We may want to limit this to batches of 100 by simply adding a WHERE clause.  This job could then run every 15 minutes and it will happily stay on top of the load for a long time.

If we end up very popular and do 1000 jobs in a day, we could exceed the runtime limit and have the job be killed, leaving us in a potentially icky place.

 Updated to follow a very similar approach to  . Both are currently set to run once an hour, which should be hella sufficient for a while, I'd think. If we get to the point where we're running more than 2400 transactions a day, I'll be a happy man. And we'll probably have someone else running this shit at that point.

## Verify Database COMMIT process

We need to confirm if the database is committing after every statement, or if it is running in a transaction.  If it's transaction, that will change some of the logic on our jobs to ensure we don't end up in a wonky state.

## Harden Sending Payment Emails

Description
In send-payment-reminder-emails/index.ts we have a similar problem to .  We can end up in a state where we've sent the email but the DB update fails and we may sen duplicate emails.
Requirements
I'd suggest a similar solution to :

Add a new IS_SENDING_EMAIL field to the Transactions table (BOOLEAN)
Update the transaction first to say "IS_SENDING_EMAIL" and set it to TRUE
Then if it's TRUE and we try to send another email, we may want to use a separate template that says "Hey we may have sent you an email already, but we wanted to be sure you got notified"
Then update the transaction like currently but set IS_SENDING_EMAIL to false

## Harden Front End Errors

Description
If an error occurs in the API, the front end simply says "There was an error loading Payment Plans" (note that this is not limited to PaymetPlans; anywhere an API call fails we need to harden).   This needs to give the user some better details about what happened and what to do.
Requirements
Improve the language to tell the user that nothing is scary, all is well
Offer a refresh button to manually refresh or tell the user to reload the page

## Change Stripe Webhook Handling

Description
See sub tasks for specific issues
This is in a job, but shouldn't it be in the API as Stripe needs to hit our webhook endpoint?

## Improve error handling for unknown transaction ID

if we have a transaction come in from Stripe but no known Transaction ID in our system, that should send us an email, not just return a failure to Stripe

This is a big WTF scenario

## Improve handlePaymentIntentSucceeded

Why are we not setting the Payment Plan to active as soon as it is created?  Once the plan is approved it's active, regardless if they have made a payment yet

Note, if we drop this requirement, then we don't need to fix this:
This whole thing needs wrapped in a transaction with the Database (see )
You do NOT want a few transactions completed and others not.  The whole thing needs to start a transaction and after the very last DB command is executed, it should commit the entire transaction.  This will ensure it all completes

- ID: 868ac0eg9

## Improve handlePaymentIntentFailed

This one may require some conversation.

How many attempts do we have before we fully fail?
We need to track the attempts in the DB an the attempt count so we can take action based off of that
Why isn't this notifying anyone of the failure?
We need to understand what caused the error
Depending on the error, like the Card was Declined, that's different than wrong address on file sort of thing.  We will need to make decisions on what to do based off of the error condition
Why do we update the plan to failed on the first failure?  I think we want a backoff process where the first one fails, sends out a notice that it failed, and that we'll need X more tries

## Discuss Reviews

I didn't see anything in the web code for reviews; is this a feature we're offering?  We're storing it in the DB and handling the event.

I also don't see it handled in the switch on line 36, so review notifications will fail...

## Discuss Payouts

I think we need to show all of the payouts to the user in a Payouts page, not just the dashboard.  Note that this probably becomes a task of its own as a feature request, but making sure I start with this in the Stripe Webhook handler.

I also don't see it handled in the switch on line 36, so payout notifications will fail...

## Payment Plan Creation is buggy

In Safari, MacOS 18, I went through the steps to create a payment plan.  When I got to the payment details section, the screen stuttered a bit before the CC fields popped in.

## Missing Logout button

How the heck do I log out?????

Also, how long am I logged in for...?  I see that supabase auth should handle RefreshTokens and all that jazz, so hopefully if you let it sit for long enough it will auto log you out, but if you're using the app it won't log you out.

## Payment Plan creating doubled

I started creating a payment plan for "Spock", but didn't get all the way through.  Somehow, it created 2 payment plans...

I think the backend is too aggressively creating it in the DB and it needs to save all of that info in the frontend until the user okays the plan.

## Discuss recent emails sent to customer

I naturally wanted to see WHAT you sent to the customer, but I can't click into those emails and view them.  It may be a good idea to store what we're actually sending out so you can click and view what was sent to the customer and when.

I don't know what we're using yet for the email, but some email services would let us download the raw payload.  That's probably overkill IMO.

## Admin Section

We will probably want to flesh out what all we want to see here.  A few things would be:

Ability to possess a user
This way we don't have to monkey with admin views for all of their data
Ability to override plans
Not sure if we need this if we possess a user, but having an all powerful zone could be nice
Roll up details
Amount we've made
Number of active plans
Number of users
Others?

    RETURNING payment_plan_id INTO v_payment_plan_id;

    -- Check if this is the first paid transaction for the payment plan
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_count
    FROM transactions
